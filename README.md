# FileOperationsConsolApp
In this project, it is aimed to perform addition and subtraction between two large numbers (numbers with a large number of digits, for example 1000000). These numbers will be read from two separate files named sayi1.txt and sayi2.txt and the result of the operation will be stored in the file named results.txt. When the program is run, the menu appears in front of the user as follows.
